### - üîó ***Possible Errors:***

#### Q: The updater doesn't run, and I see error messages. What now?  
A: The Sims 4 Updater is built in Python 3.10, which ended Windows 7 support with version 3.9. If you're on Windows 7, upgrade to Windows 8 or higher. Additionally, make sure you have **VC Redist 2015-2022 x64** installed, and ensure your antivirus isn‚Äôt blocking the updater. If you‚Äôre determined to stay on Windows 7, there‚Äôs a workaround, but we can't provide assistance with that.

#### Q: I'm getting metadata errors. How can I fix them?  
A: First, try disabling your firewall. If the issue persists, use a VPN and let the Updater fetch data from a different server. If you're already on a VPN, switching to another one may resolve the problem.

#### Q: Why is the update process so slow?  
A: The updater's speed may be affected by server congestion in your region. Refer to the metadata errors solution above for tips on speeding up the process.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notice:**

The Sims 4 uses multiple executable files. When running a legit copy from the EA App/Steam (on Windows or Linux), it launches **TS4_Launcher_x64.exe**, which, in turn, runs another executable based on your settings. By default, it runs the **DirectX 11** version unless you manually opt for **DirectX 9**. For cracked versions, you can skip the launcher and run the desired executable directly.

- **TS4_x64.exe** uses **DirectX 11**  
- **TS4_DX9_x64.exe** uses **DirectX 9**  

If you face any visual issues with the DX11 version, try switching to DX9. If you're installing **ReShade**, make sure to choose the correct version for your chosen executable. **Do not install ReShade twice** unless you want to risk breaking the game.
